## Description

The Mobile Iddir App is a community-based mobile application designed to help our local communities manage their mutual aid societies (Iddirs). The app provides an efficient platform for managing subscriptions, payments, and emergency support requests among members of the Iddir.

## Features

### 1. Subscription Management and Payment System
   - Subscription Payment: Members will contribute regularly to the Iddir using a payment method of their choice (Mobile banking, telebirr, and more), and they will upload the screenshot which will be verified by the adminstrator.
   - Automatic Payment Reminders: The app will send notifications about upcoming subscription dues, ensuring timely payments.
   - Payment History: Users can view their payment history stored locally on the device.

### 2. Emergency Support and Request System
   - Request for Assistance: Members can request emergency support (e.g., funeral assistance, medical support, etc.). The app allows users to submit a request with details such as the nature of the emergency and the amount of support required.
   - Community Contributions: Other members of the Iddir will be notified of emergency more efficiently and can contribute in additional funds to support emergency requests. Contributions are stored and tracked.
   - Approval and Coordination: The Iddir administrators can approve or deny requests, and they can manage the allocation of funds and other resources.
   - Notifications: The app will notify members when a support request is made, when contributions are collected, and when resources are distributed.

### 3. Admin Dashboard
   - User Management: Admins can view and manage members, including their profiles, payment history, and participation in emergency support.
   - Transaction History: Admins can view detailed logs of all transactions, including incoming payments and distributions for emergency support.
   - Fundraising Events: Admins can create special fundraising events for larger emergencies, allowing the community to contribute to a pooled fund for more significant causes.
